## Hello! I'm Janrey `CodexLink` Licas üëã

I'm a 3rd Computer Engineering Student in **Technological Institute of the Philippines** specializing in **Intelligent Systems** ***(Generally Known as Embedded Systems)*** whose passion was to create anything that is personally beneficial as best possible with complex implementations that would certainly follows certain standards in code patterns and abstraction methods in any other way.

### What do I do in the Open-Source Environment?

Generally nothing in the first place. But I do share my stuff that will certainly be stored-ridden somewhere in my hard drive. I share my works via repositories so that other people might learn (**hopefully**) something from it.

Most of the repositories that I have are (will be) fully documented so check them out along with my findings and conclusions. Such as this [repository](https://github.com/CodexLink/SmartClassroomSystem).

I also do help/contribute in some repositories that I found interesting or I found as one of my needs that may require some help by offering unusual solutions that could solve particular problems on the codebase but **very rarely**.
