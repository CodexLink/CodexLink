## Hello! I'm CodexLinkðŸ‘‹
**Thank you for Visiting my Github Profile!**

- I'm currently an **Embedded-Focused** 3rd-Year Computer Engineering Student in the **Technological Institute of the Philippines**. 
- Doesn't have any forte-like programming language. Labelled self as a quite average. Potential but lazy.
- Known PLs: C++, Python and JS.
- Known Package / Frameworks: NodeJS, VueJS, Win32API, Django, Django-REST-API from one of those categories though.

### Repository Note
Most of my projects here is archived since I was in 1st Year College. And most of them were licensed under the following: `BSD 3-Clause`, `GNU v3`, and `MIT` Licenses. So feel free to check them out :)

### About Pinned Repositories 
Those repositories contains much more than what I have as usual and they represent the things that I learned from the day I made them. If you looked at them one-by-one properly, most of them were either **properly documented** and **finished** or in the process of refining represented by other branch (aside from master).

### About Other Repositories
Keep in mind, most of my projects that I recently learned while in the process in making those project were quite flawed and has some logic errors. So expect messy code but it works on multiple parts of the codebase.
