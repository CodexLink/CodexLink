## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Janrey "`CodexLink`" Licas

A Python-based, Caffeine-dependent, and Computer Engineering Graduate (_specializing in **Intelligent Systems / Embedded Systems**_) **Backend Developer**. I also do Full-Stack (_with Python + (Vue.js || Django)_), but currently in-practice with TypeScript, React and maybe later on, Vue.js (_again). (_currently commencing_). 

I like to **over-detail** my craft, **over-complicate** my solutions for the sake of compatibility over simplicity (***leaning more towards extensibility and reusability for the things I do***), and DRY those implementations with considerations for the context.

### Current State

Despite already graduated, I'm currently doing volunteer work with JuanLoop ([Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/itsJuanLoop) | [Site](https://www.itsjuanloop.com/)) as a **Software Engineer** for the sake of building my foundation while attempting to work at my personal site with portfolio (_repo privated for now_).

My current role is **Backend Developer** that handles CI, error reports, analytics integration, AWS services and much more. Technically involved in the Full-Stack work but my main focus is the backend part. I recently handled Frontend but only with the function integration part.

### Preferences

I work all-around with the developments that I have, thus having no decision on what area of expertise I should work on; but usually I like to do some integration stuff than doing and handling everything for such one project. Design is not something I can do _extensively_, but I can design.

If you have something you want me to work on, please let me know! (_through my email on the side_)

### :thinking: What am I doing right now?

* :arrow_forward: Create a workaround for nerd-fonts' TTC feature, ([which was this PR](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/783) by calculating estimated space used which may halt users that exceeds `OpenType` font 65,535 limitations. (Enqueued in 10/18/2022, **IN-PROGRESS**)

* :arrow_forward: Reconfiguring `nvim` with `lua` finally this time. (Re-queued in 10/18/2022, **IN-PROGRESS**)

* :pause_button: [Discord Activity Badge](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) revival refactor plan will start after nvim reconfiguration!

* :bangbang: Currently evaluating all of the repositories that I have (_demo then refactor then demo_), plus, thinking of ideas that I can do while learning TypeScript and Node.js as part of creating a portfolio.

> I'm currently re-evaluating my life roadmap until endgame as well as doing volunteer work with JuanLoop, so things are expected to move slower.

### :bar_chart: Knowledge Table

This table contains technology stacks and frameworks that I recently discontinued to learn/used (but has recent experience with them), currently learning, and to-be-planned or on the phase of on-halt due to time conflicts.
