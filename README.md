## 👋 Hello! I'm Janrey Licas, known as `CodexLink`.

A **Python**-based Developer that university-specializes on **Intelligent Systems / Embedded Systems**.

I'm currently a **Backend Developer**, taking my free time before starting my journey to self-explore the Full-Stack Technology. I already did Full-Stack before with Python + Vue.js and Django, but I'm not confident yet.

I'm practicing **over-detailing** my craft for the sake of compatibility over simplicity as I always lean more towards extensibility and reusability, and use **DRY** principles to my implementations with considerations for the context; as well as be redundant on a small context than a bigger one.

Quite a pedantic but I'm always aware with Code Quality and Implementation-wise Functionalities.

### Current State

[1] I'm currently doing a **low-key**-volunteer work with JuanLoop ([Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/itsJuanLoop) | [Site](https://www.itsjuanloop.com/)) as a **Software Engineer** for the sake of building my foundation while working with my hobbies and personal projects.

My current role is **Backend Developer**, I handle CI, error reports, analytics integration, AWS services and much more. Technically involved in the Full-Stack workflow but my main focus is the backend integration.

[2] I'm currently focused and interested on creating an automation strategy for trading. This is why I'm not currently active at my personal projects.

### Preferences

I work all-around with the developments that I have, thus having no decision on what area of expertise I should work on; but usually I like to do some integration stuff than doing and handling everything for such one project. Design is not something I can do _extensively_, but I can do it.

### :thinking: What am I doing right now?

* :arrow_forward: Currently doing a trading strategy + automation as a potential side line while I'm progressing in my personal projects + others (which is currently on pause right now).

* :arrow_forward: Reconfiguring `nvim` with `lua` finally this time. ~~(Updated since 11/06/2022, [**IN-PROGRESS**](https://github.com/CodexLink/dotfiles-configs-archive/tree/latest/editors/nvim/lua))~~ (**Currently on PAUSE**)

* :pause_button: [Discord Activity Badge](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) revival refactor plan will start after nvim reconfiguration!

* :pause_button: I'm planning (_asynchronously while working on Discord Activity Badge_) on designing my website for portfolio purposes.

* :pause_button: Create a workaround for nerd-fonts' TTC feature, ([which was this PR](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/783) by calculating estimated space used which may halt users that exceeds `OpenType` font 65,535 limitations. (Enqueued in 10/18/2022, **HALTED**)

* :pause_button: Currently evaluating all of the repositories that I have (_demo then refactor then demo_), plus, thinking of ideas that I can do while learning TypeScript and Node.js as part of creating a portfolio. (Updated since 11/06/2022, **HALTED**)

> I'm currently re-evaluating my life roadmap until endgame as well as doing volunteer work with JuanLoop, so things are expected to move slower.
> 
> I'm also currently mentally drained as I cannot do everything despite taking time off for a half a year, but I can still handle things out.

### :bar_chart: Knowledge Table

This table contains technology stacks and frameworks that I recently discontinued to learn/used (but has recent experience with them), currently learning, and to-be-planned or on the phase of on-halt due to time conflicts.
