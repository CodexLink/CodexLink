## Hello! I'm CodexLinkðŸ‘‹
 **And, Thank you for visiting my Github Profile!**

I'm currently an **Embedded-Focused** 3rd-Year Computer Engineering Student in the **Technological Institute of the Philippines**. I don't have any forte programming language but I could label myself as a quite average at knowing them in the world of software engineering (I do get compliments all the time but high standards makes me discard it, I dont want to stay on what ceiling them have, I wanna go further and consider things I have as an average). Those PLs that I know are: C++, Python and JS. Package / Frameworks that I know so far is: NodeJS, VueJS, Win32API, Django, Django-REST-API from one of those categories though. ***I do learn PLs / Frameworks / Modules, but I dont have enough reason to dig on them. What I need is what I learn.***

### Repository Note
Most of my projects here is archived since I was in 1st Year College. And most of them were licensed under the following: 'BSD 3-Clause', 'GNU v3', and 'MIT'. So feel free to check them out :)

### About Pinned Repositories 
Those repositories contains much more than what I have as usual and they represent the things that I learned from the day I made them. If you looked at them one-by-one properly, most of them were either **properly documented** and **finished** or in the process of refining represented by other branch (aside from master).

### About Other Repositories
Keep in mind, most of my projects that I recently learned while in the process in making those project were quite flawed and has some logic errors. And some of them are incomplete as well. You might be too surprised the fact that the detail of my repository feels like I did finished **ALL** of them. But they were not. But has a plans for them soon. Keep in mind that, some implementations were forcibly different than what might others think. I always try to make things quite difficult to compensate the ability of reusing them or based from what I see. Some parts were suck and some parts were quite fine but requires improvement / iteration.
